# MSD

The code computes the optimal route path for several locations. It can be used for example by a delivery person, who has to visit all the locations and in the end to return to the base  :

- compute the distances between all the coordinates
- create the coresponding graph
- running the TSP algorithm
- displaying the minimal cost route
